# Pima-Indians-Diabetes-classification-problem
---
Goal of this project
---

This machine learning solution aimed to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.

---
About the dataset and its source.
---

PIMA are a group of people in Indian. They are immigrants with a high chance of having type 2 diabetes.
The dataset has 7 features. The patients here are female. 

---
Approach of my solution
---
Employed logistic regression algorithm to classify.
This is supervised techniques (as we have a label for the target variable)

---
Results from the approach
---
